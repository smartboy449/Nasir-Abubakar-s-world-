    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Nasir Abubakar. I am a 13-year-old boy from Kano, Nigeria. I have a big dream – to become an engineer and build the fastest AI in the world. Ever since I was little, I have always loved technology. I enjoy learning new things, building websites, and thinking about how machines work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I am still young, I work very hard every day. I study coding, practice English, and design web pages with passion and focus. I believe that with strong determination, good guidance, and trust in Allah, I will one day achieve something amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dream is not just for me, but for the world. I want to inspire other young people from Nigeria and beyond. I want to tell the world, including Elon Musk and OpenAI, that the next generation of great minds is rising, and I am one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is the first step in my journey. I am proud of it, and I know it is only the beginning. I will keep working, keep improving, and one day, the whole world will hear my name – Nasir the Smart Winner Boy.
