    My story begins in Kano, Nigeria, where I grew up with a big dream in my heart. Ever since I was little, I was amazed by how technology could change the world.
    <br><br>
    I decided I didn't want to just use technology â€” I wanted to create it. I started learning how to code, and I knew this was my path. Every day, I practice, I study, and I imagine the future I'm going to build.
    <br><br>
    I dream of building the fastest AI in the world. One that can help people, solve problems, and make the world better. I believe that even at 13 years old, I have the power to start something big.
    <br><br>
    This is just the beginning. Welcome to my story.
