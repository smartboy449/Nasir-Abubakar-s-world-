# 🌍 Nasir Abubakar's Dream Website

Welcome to my personal website! I'm **Nasir Abubakar**, a 13-year-old future engineer from Kano, Nigeria 🇳🇬.

This website is my dream project, where I share:
- 💡 Who I am (`About Me`)

I created this website step-by-step using HTML and CSS. My dream is to become the best engineer in the world and build the fastest AI ever.
